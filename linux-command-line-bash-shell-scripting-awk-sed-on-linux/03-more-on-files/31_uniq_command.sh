# Geetika
# Neha
# Priyanka

# Can  "-" in place of the Input file, because we piping output of uniq command to Standard Input
# Then it will take Standard Input and write to file names2
sort names | uniq - names2
cat names2

# OR could simply just redirect the output straight to file
sort names | uniq > names3

#################### Delete Multiple Blank Lines ####################
# File containing extra blank lines
cat file1 

# Now there is only one single blank line between 
uniq file1 
uniq file1 > file2

#################### Basic Example ####################
# Remove adjacent dupes and send output to another file  
uniq names names 1

# Remove non-adjacent dupes and send to another file 
sort names |uniq â€“ names2 or $sort names | uniq > names3
